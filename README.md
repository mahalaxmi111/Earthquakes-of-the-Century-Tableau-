## Overview
The **Earthquake Dashboard** is an interactive visualization tool that allows users to explore significant earthquakes from 1921 to the present. It provides insights into the frequency, magnitude, damage costs, and fatalities associated with these earthquakes. The dashboard is built using modern web technologies and leverages powerful data visualization libraries.

## Features
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Users can hover over data points to view detailed information about each earthquake.
- **Historical Data Exploration**: Analyze significant earthquakes based on criteria such as magnitude, damage costs, and fatalities.
- **Dynamic Mapping**: A color-coded map displays earthquake severity across different regions.
- **Multi-Metric Analysis**: View data filtered by various metrics including damages, injuries, and deaths.

## Data Sources
The dataset used in this project classifies significant earthquakes based on the following criteria:
- Caused death or moderate damage (approximately $1 million or more)
- Magnitude of 7.5 or greater
- Intensity (MMI) X or greater
- Tsunami generation

### Earthquake Classification
Earthquakes are categorized into classes based on their magnitude:
- **Great**: 8.0 or more
- **Major**: 7.0 - 7.9
- **Strong**: 6.0 - 6.9
- **Moderate**: 5.0 - 5.9
- **Light**: 4.0 - 4.9
- **Minor**: 3.0 - 3.9
- **Micro**: Less than 2.0

## Visualizations
The dashboard includes several key visualizations:
1. **Significant Earthquakes Over Time**: A line chart displaying the number of significant earthquakes per year.
2. **Earthquake Distribution by Magnitude**: A bar chart illustrating occurrences across different magnitude classes.
3. **Interactive Earthquake Map**: Displays earthquake data with color coding for severity and allows filtering by various metrics such as damages, injuries, and fatalities.

### Available Maps Include:
- Earthquakes by Magnitude
- Damages in Millions of Dollars
- Number of Injuries
- Number of Houses Destroyed
- Number of Missing Persons
- Number of Deaths
